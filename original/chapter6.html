understand. We all think ourselves pretty clever, of course, but we
are mere human beings, and even a moderate amount of chaos tends to
baffle us. And then it all goes downhill. Working on something you do
not really understand is a bit like cutting random wires on those
time-activated bombs they always have in movies. If you are lucky, you
might get the right one ― especially if you are the hero of the movie
and strike a suitably dramatic pose ― but there is always the
possibility of blowing everything up.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p48332aa5" name="p48332aa5"> ¶ </a>Admittedly, in most cases, breaking a program does not cause any large
explosions. But when a program, by someone's ignorant tinkering, has
degenerated into a ramshackle mass of errors, reshaping it into
something sensible is a terrible labour ― sometimes you might just as
well start over.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p22f00be3" name="p22f00be3"> ¶ </a><a name="key1"></a>Thus, the programmer is always looking for ways to keep
the complexity of his programs as low as possible. An important way to
do this is to try and make code more abstract. When writing a program,
it is easy to get sidetracked into small details at every point. You
come across some little issue, and you deal with it, and then proceed
to the next little problem, and so on. This makes the code read like a
grandmother's tale.</p><blockquote>Yes, dear, to make pea soup you will need split peas, the dry kind.
And you have to soak them at least for a night, or you will have to
cook them for hours and hours. I remember one time, when my dull son
tried to make pea soup. Would you believe he hadn't soaked the peas?
We almost broke our teeth, all of us. Anyway, when you have soaked
the peas, and you'll want about a cup of them per person, and pay
attention because they will expand a bit while they are soaking, so
if you aren't careful they will spill out of whatever you use to
hold them, so also use plenty water to soak in, but as I said, about
a cup of them, when they are dry, and after they are soaked you cook
them in four cups of water per cup of dry peas. Let it simmer for
two hours, which means you cover it and keep it barely cooking, and
then add some diced onions, sliced celery stalk, and maybe a carrot
or two and some ham. Let it all cook for a few minutes more, and it
is ready to eat.</blockquote><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p14dcdc06" name="p14dcdc06"> ¶ </a>Another way to describe this recipe:</p><blockquote>Per person: one cup dried split peas, half a chopped onion, half a
carrot, a celery stalk, and optionally ham.<br/><br/>Soak peas overnight, simmer them for two hours in four cups of water
(per person), add vegetables and ham, and cook for ten more minutes.</blockquote><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p11843d6d" name="p11843d6d"> ¶ </a>This is shorter, but if you don't know how to soak peas you'll surely
screw up and put them in too little water. But how to soak peas can be
looked up, and that is the trick. If you assume a certain basic
knowledge in the audience, you can talk in a language that deals with
bigger concepts, and express things in a much shorter and clearer way.
This, more or less, is what abstraction is.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p74512153" name="p74512153"> ¶ </a>How is this far-fetched recipe story relevant to programming? Well,
obviously, the recipe is the program. Furthermore, the basic knowledge
that the cook is supposed to have corresponds to the functions and
other constructs that are available to the programmer. If you remember
the introduction of this book, things like <code>while</code> make it easier to
build loops, and in <a href="chapter4.html">chapter 4</a> we wrote some simple functions in order to
make other functions shorter and more straightforward. Such tools,
some of them made available by the language itself, others built by
the programmer, are used to reduce the amount of uninteresting details
in the rest of the program, and thus make that program easier to work
with.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4bd24fc8" name="p4bd24fc8"> ¶ </a><a name="key2"></a>Functional programming, which is the subject
of this chapter, produces abstraction through clever ways of combining
functions. A programmer armed with a repertoire of fundamental
functions and, more importantly, the knowledge on how to use them, is
much more effective than one who starts from scratch. Unfortunately, a
standard JavaScript environment comes with deplorably few essential
functions, so we have to write them ourselves or, which is often
preferable, make use of somebody else's code (more on that in
<a href="chapter9.html">chapter 9</a>).</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p493dfe2f" name="p493dfe2f"> ¶ </a>There are other popular approaches to abstraction, most notably
object-oriented programming, the subject of <a href="chapter8.html">chapter 8</a>.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p41af5b12" name="p41af5b12"> ¶ </a>One ugly detail that, if you have any good taste at all, must be
starting to bother you is the endlessly repeated <code>for</code> loop going over
an array: <code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; something.length; i++) ...</code>. Can this
be abstracted?</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p233c1f28" name="p233c1f28"> ¶ </a>The problem is that, whereas most functions just take some values,
combine them, and return something, such a loop contains a piece of
code that it must execute. It is easy to write a function that goes
over an array and prints out every element:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">printArray</span>(<span class="variabledef">array</span>) {
  <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variabledef">i</span> = <span class="atom">0</span>; <span class="localvariable">i</span> &lt; <span class="localvariable">array</span>.<span class="property">length</span>; <span class="localvariable">i</span>++)

}</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p59124288" name="p59124288"> ¶ </a>But what if we want to do something else than print? Since 'doing
something' can be represented as a function, and functions are also
values, we can pass our action as a function value:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">forEach</span>(<span class="variabledef">array</span>, <span class="variabledef">action</span>) {
  <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variabledef">i</span> = <span class="atom">0</span>; <span class="localvariable">i</span> &lt; <span class="localvariable">array</span>.<span class="property">length</span>; <span class="localvariable">i</span>++)

function because of the lexical scoping rules. Also note that this
version is hardly shorter than the <code>for</code> loop and requires a rather
clunky <code>});</code> at its end ― the brace closes the body of the anonymous
function, the parenthesis closes the function call to <a name="key3"></a><code>forEach</code>, and
the semicolon is needed because this call is a statement.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5dd5ffb7" name="p5dd5ffb7"> ¶ </a>You do get a variable bound to the current element in the array,
<code>number</code>, so there is no need to use <code>numbers[i]</code> anymore, and when
this array is created by evaluating some expression, there is no need

directly.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p43687e97" name="p43687e97"> ¶ </a>The cat-code in <a href="chapter4.html">chapter 4</a> contains a piece like this:</p><pre class="preformatted">var paragraphs = mailArchive[mail].split(&quot;\n&quot;);

results in more information and less noise: The code in <code>sum</code> reads
'<em>for each number in numbers add that number to the total</em>', instead
of... '<em>there is this variable that starts at zero, and it counts
upward to the length of the array called numbers, and for every value
of this variable we look up the corresponding element in the array and
add this to the total</em>'.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p381c8ab4" name="p381c8ab4"> ¶ </a>What <code>forEach</code> does is take an algorithm, in this case 'going over an
array', and abstract it. The 'gaps' in the algorithm, in this case,
what to do for each of these elements, are filled by functions which
are passed to the algorithm function.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p55eb429c" name="p55eb429c"> ¶ </a>Functions that operate on other functions are called <a name="key4"></a>higher-order
functions. By operating on functions, they can talk about actions on
a whole new level. The <code>makeAddFunction</code> function from <a href="chapter3.html">chapter 3</a> is
also a higher-order function. Instead of taking a function value as an
argument, it produces a new function.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2a85a26a" name="p2a85a26a"> ¶ </a>Higher-order functions can be used to generalise many algorithms that
regular functions can not easily describe. When you have a repertoire
of these functions at your disposal, it can help you think about your
code in a clearer way: Instead of a messy set of variables and loops,
you can decompose algorithms into a combination of a few fundamental
algorithms, which are invoked by name, and do not have to be typed out
again and again.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p7333b993" name="p7333b993"> ¶ </a>Being able to write <em>what</em> we want to do instead of <em>how</em> we do it

%% The Two Aspects

Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort,
it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and
regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The
essence stays invisibly below.

When the creators built the machine, they put in the processor and the
memory. From these arise the two aspects of the program.

The aspect of the processor is the active substance. It is called
Control. The aspect of the memory is the passive substance. It is
called Data.

Data is made of merely bits, yet it takes complex forms. Control
consists only of simple instructions, yet it performs difficult
tasks. From the small and trivial, the large and complex arise.

The program source is Data. Control arises from it. The Control
proceeds to create new Data. The one is born from the other, the
other is useless without the one. This is the harmonious cycle of
Data and Control.

Of themselves, Data and Control are without structure. The programmers
of old moulded their programs out of this raw substance. Over time,
the amorphous Data has crystallised into data types, and the chaotic
Control was restricted into control structures and functions.

%% Short Sayings

When a student asked Fu-Tzu about the nature of the cycle of Data and
Control, Fu-Tzu replied 'Think of a compiler, compiling itself.'

A student asked 'The programmers of old used only simple machines and
no programming languages, yet they made beautiful programs. Why do we
use complicated machines and programming languages?'. Fu-Tzu replied
'The builders of old used only sticks and clay, yet they made
beautiful huts.'

A hermit spent ten years writing a program. 'My program can compute
the motion of the stars on a 286-computer running MS DOS', he proudly
announced. 'Nobody owns a 286-computer or uses MS DOS anymore.',
Fu-Tzu responded.

Fu-Tzu had written a small program that was full of global state and
dubious shortcuts. Reading it, a student asked 'You warned us against
these techniques, yet I find them in your program. How can this be?'
Fu-Tzu said 'There is no need to fetch a water hose when the house is
not on fire.'{This is not to be read as an encouragement of sloppy
programming, but rather as a warning against neurotic adherence to
rules of thumb.}

%% Wisdom

A student was complaining about digital numbers. 'When I take the root
of two and then square it again, the result is already inaccurate!'.
Overhearing him, Fu-Tzu laughed. 'Here is a sheet of paper. Write down
the precise value of the square root of two for me.'

Fu-Tzu said 'When you cut against the grain of the wood, much strength
is needed. When you program against the grain of a problem, much code
is needed.'

Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest
programs. 'Two-hundred thousand lines', said Tzu-li, 'not counting
comments!'. 'Psah', said Tzu-ssu, 'mine is almost a *million* lines
already.' Fu-Tzu said 'My best program has five hundred lines.'
Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened.

A student had been sitting motionless behind his computer for hours,
frowning darkly. He was trying to write a beautiful solution to a
difficult problem, but could not find the right approach. Fu-Tzu hit
him on the back of his head and shouted '*Type something!*' The student
started writing an ugly solution. After he had finished, he suddenly
understood the beautiful solution.

%% Progression

A beginning programmer writes his programs like an ant builds her
hill, one piece at a time, without thought for the bigger structure.
His programs will be like loose sand. They may stand for a while, but
growing too big they fall apart{Referring to the danger of internal
inconsistency and duplicated structure in unorganised code.}.

Realising this problem, the programmer will start to spend a lot of
time thinking about structure. His programs will be rigidly
structured, like rock sculptures. They are solid, but when they must
change, violence must be done to them{Referring to the fact that
structure tends to put restrictions on the evolution of a program.}.

The master programmer knows when to apply structure and when to leave
things in their simple form. His programs are like clay, solid yet
malleable.

%% Language

When a programming language is created, it is given syntax and
semantics. The syntax describes the form of the program, the semantics
describe the function. When the syntax is beautiful and the semantics
are clear, the program will be like a stately tree. When the syntax is
clumsy and the semantics confusing, the program will be like a bramble
bush.

Tzu-ssu was asked to write a program in the language called Java,
which takes a very primitive approach to functions. Every morning, as
he sat down in front of his computer, he started complaining. All day
he cursed, blaming the language for all that went wrong. Fu-Tzu
listened for a while, and then reproached him, saying 'Every language
has its own way. Follow its form, do not try to program as if you
were using another language.'</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6210d6e" name="p6210d6e"> ¶ </a>To honour the memory of our good recluse, I would like to finish his

like this:</p><ol><li>Split the file into paragraphs by cutting it at every empty line.</li><li>Remove the '%' characters from header paragraphs and mark them as headers.</li><li>Process the text of the paragraphs themselves, splitting them into normal parts, emphasised parts, and footnotes.</li><li>Move all the footnotes to the bottom of the document, leaving numbers<a class="footref" href="#footnote1">1</a> in their place.</li><li>Wrap each piece into the correct HTML tags.</li><li>Combine everything into a single HTML document.</li></ol><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p43aa90ef" name="p43aa90ef"> ¶ </a>This approach does not allow footnotes inside emphasised text, or vice

<code>asArray</code> function is necessary to make normal arrays out of the
<code>arguments</code> objects. It copies their content into a real array, so
that the <code>concat</code> method can be used on it. It also takes an optional
second argument, which can be used to leave out some arguments at the
start.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p255ffd22" name="p255ffd22"> ¶ </a>Also note that it is necessary to store the <code>arguments</code> of the outer
function (<code>partial</code>) into a variable with another name, because
otherwise the inner function can not see them ― it has its own
<code>arguments</code> variable, which shadows the one of the outer function.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p68397052" name="p68397052"> ¶ </a>Now <code>equals(10)</code> could be written as <code>partial(op[&quot;==&quot;], 10)</code>, without
the need for a specialized <code>equals</code> function. And you can do things
like this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">map</span>(<span class="variable">partial</span>(<span class="variable">op</span>[<span class="string">&quot;+&quot;</span>], <span class="atom">1</span>), [<span class="atom">0</span>, <span class="atom">2</span>, <span class="atom">4</span>, <span class="atom">6</span>, <span class="atom">8</span>, <span class="atom">10</span>]));</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p662c705c" name="p662c705c"> ¶ </a>The reason <code>map</code> takes its function argument before its array argument
is that it is often useful to partially apply map by giving it a
function. This 'lifts' the function from operating on a single value
to operating on an array of values. For example, if you have an array
of arrays of numbers, and you want to square them all, you do this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">square</span>(<span class="variabledef">x</span>) {<span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="localvariable">x</span> * <span class="localvariable">x</span>;}

is <a name="key15"></a>function composition. At the start of this chapter I showed a
function <code>negate</code>, which applies the boolean <em>not</em> operator to the
result of calling a function:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">negate</span>(<span class="variabledef">func</span>) {
  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">function</span>() {

apply function B to the result. Composition is a common concept in
mathematics. <a name="key16"></a>It can be caught in a higher-order function

keyword at all. This can be useful when you need to create a simple
function to give to, for example, <code>map</code> or <code>reduce</code>. However, when a
function becomes more complex than these examples, it is usually
shorter (not to mention more efficient) to just write it out with
<code>function</code>.</p></div><ol class="footnotes"><li><a name="footnote1"></a>Like this...</li></ol><div class="navigation"><a href="chapter5.html">&lt;&lt; Previous chapter</a> | <a href="contents.html">Contents</a> | <a href="index.html">Cover</a> | <a href="chapter7.html">Next chapter &gt;&gt;</a></div><div class="footer">© <a href="mailto:marijnh@gmail.com">Marijn Haverbeke</a> (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">license</a>), written March to July 2007, last modified on March 22 2013.</div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="js/mochi.js"> </script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/codemirror.js"> </script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/ejs.js"> </script></body></html>
