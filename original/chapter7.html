way too easy to just zoom over the text, nod solemnly, and promptly
forget what you have read. If you make a sincere effort to solve a
problem, it becomes <em>your</em> problem, and its solution will be more
meaningful.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p44817971" name="p44817971"> ¶ </a>The first aspect of this problem is, again, representing our data. The

twenty-thousand maps to interpret, this would be a good idea, in this

a more computer-friendly format.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3734f442" name="p3734f442"> ¶ </a>What does our program need to know? It has to be able to look up which

just store an array of road objects, each of which contains properties

noise.</p></div></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4858596" name="p4858596"> ¶ </a>To find a route on this map without having our browser cut off the
program because it takes too long to finish, we have to stop our
amateurish attempts and implement a serious algorithm. A lot of work
has gone into problems like this in the past, and many solutions have
been designed (some brilliant, others useless). A very popular and
efficient one is called <a name="key12"></a>A* (pronounced A-star). We will spend the
rest of the chapter implementing an A* route-finding function for our
map.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3fe7ae6c" name="p3fe7ae6c"> ¶ </a>Before I get to the algorithm itself, let me tell you a bit more about
the problem it solves. The trouble with searching routes through
graphs is that, in big graphs, there are an awful lot of them. Our
Hiva Oa path-finder showed that, when the graph is small, all we needed
to do was to make sure our paths didn't revisit points they had
already passed. On our new map, this is not enough anymore.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4a84de17" name="p4a84de17"> ¶ </a>The fundamental problem is that there is too much room for going in
the wrong direction. Unless we somehow manage to steer our exploration
of paths towards the goal, a choice we make for continuing a given
path is more likely to go in the wrong direction than in the right
direction. If you keep generating paths like that, you end up with an
enormous amount of paths, and even if one of them accidentally reaches
the end point, you do not know whether that is the shortest path.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p197abedf" name="p197abedf"> ¶ </a>So what you want to do is explore directions that are likely to get
you to the end point first. On a grid like our map, you can get a
rough estimate of how good a path is by checking how long it is and
how close its end is to the end point. By adding path length and an
estimate of the distance it still has to go, you can get a rough idea
of which paths are promising. If you extend promising paths first, you
are less likely to waste time on useless ones.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p10b55219" name="p10b55219"> ¶ </a>But that still is not enough. If our map was of a perfectly flat
plane, the path that looked promising would almost always be the best
one, and we could use the above method to walk right to our goal. But
we have valleys and hillsides blocking our paths, so it is hard to
tell in advance which direction will be the most efficient path.
Because of this, we still end up having to explore way too many paths.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p7cc689b9" name="p7cc689b9"> ¶ </a>To correct this, we can make clever use of the fact that we are
constantly exploring the most promising path first. Once we have
determined that path A is the best way to get to point X, we can
remember that. When, later on, path B also gets to point X, we know
that it is not the best route, so we do not have to explore it
further. This can prevent our program from building a lot of pointless
paths.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p45bed7ec" name="p45bed7ec"> ¶ </a>The algorithm, then, goes something like this...</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p86105d4" name="p86105d4"> ¶ </a>There are two pieces of data to keep track of. The first one is called
the open list, it contains the partial routes that must still be
explored. Each route has a score, which is calculated by adding its
length to its estimated distance from the goal. This estimate must
always be optimistic, it should never overestimate the distance. The
second is a set of nodes that we have seen, together with the shortest
partial route that got us there. This one we will call the reached
list. We start by adding a route that contains only the starting node
to the open list, and recording it in the reached list.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p605bad69" name="p605bad69"> ¶ </a>Then, as long as there are any nodes in the open list, we take out the
one that has the lowest (best) score, and find the ways in which it
can be continued (by calling <code>possibleDirections</code>). For each of the
nodes this returns, we create a new route by appending it to our
original route, and adjusting the length of the route using
<code>weightedDistance</code>. The endpoint of each of these new routes is then
looked up in the reached list.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5287d4ca" name="p5287d4ca"> ¶ </a>If the node is not in the reached list yet, it means we have not seen
it before, and we add the new route to the open list and record it in
the reached list. If we <em>had</em> seen it before, we compare the score of
the new route to the score of the route in the reached list. If the
new route is shorter, we replace the existing route with the new one.
Otherwise, we discard the new route, since we have already seen a
better way to get to that point.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3fff0a1c" name="p3fff0a1c"> ¶ </a>We continue doing this until the route we fetch from the open list
ends at the goal node, in which case we have found our route, or until
the open list is empty, in which case we have found out that there is
no route. In our case the map contains no unsurmountable obstacles, so
there is always a route.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p22f483ff" name="p22f483ff"> ¶ </a>How do we know that the first full route that we get from the open
list is also the shortest one? This is a result of the fact that we
only look at a route when it has the lowest score. The score of a
route is its actual length plus an <em>optimistic</em> estimate of the
remaining length. This means that if a route has the lowest score in
the open list, it is always the best route to its current endpoint ―
it is impossible for another route to later find a better way to that
point, because if it were better, its score would have been lower.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p17b17d31" name="p17b17d31"> ¶ </a>Try not to get frustrated when the fine points of why this works are
still eluding you. When thinking about algorithms like this, having
seen 'something like it' before helps a lot, it gives you a point of
reference to compare the approach to. Beginning programmers have to do
without such a point of reference, which makes it rather easy to get
lost. Just realise that this is advanced stuff, globally read over the
rest of the chapter, and come back to it later when you feel like a
challenge.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p22113aab" name="p22113aab"> ¶ </a>I am afraid that, for one aspect of the algorithm, I'm going to have
to invoke magic again. The open list needs to be able to hold a large
amount of routes, and to quickly find the route with the lowest score
among them. Storing them in a normal array, and searching through this
array every time, is way too slow, so I give you a data structure
called a <a name="key13"></a>binary heap. You create them with <code>new</code>, just like <code>Date</code>
objects, giving them a function that is used to 'score' its elements
as argument. The resulting object has the methods <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code>,
just like an array, but <code>pop</code> always gives you the element with the
lowest score, instead of the one that was <code>push</code>ed last.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">identity</span>(<span class="variabledef">x</span>) {

effect. The Hiva Oa algorithm used arrays of locations to store
routes, and copied them with the <code>concat</code> method when it extended
them. This time, we can not afford to copy arrays, since we will be
exploring lots and lots of routes. Instead, we use a 'chain' of
objects to store a route. Every object in the chain has some
properties, such as a point on the map, and the length of the route so
far, and it also has a property that points at the previous object in
the chain. Something like this:</p><div class="illustration"><img src="img/objectchain.png"/></div><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3ed2618" name="p3ed2618"> ¶ </a>Where the cyan circles are the relevant objects, and the lines
represent properties ― the end with the dot points at the value of
the property. Object <code>A</code> is the start of a route here. Object <code>B</code> is
used to build a new route, which continues from <code>A</code>. It has a
property, which we will call <code>from</code>, pointing at the route it is based
on. When we need to reconstruct a route later, we can follow these
properties to find all the points that the route passed. Note that
object <code>B</code> is part of two routes, one that ends in <code>D</code> and one that
ends in <code>E</code>. When there are a lot of routes, this can save us much
storage space ― every new route only needs one new object for itself,
the rest is shared with other routes that started the same way.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><a name="exercise5"></a><div class="exercisenum">Ex. 7.5</div><div class="exercise"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p698e3520" name="p698e3520"> ¶ </a>Write a function <code>estimatedDistance</code> that gives an optimistic estimate

graph can be applied to many problems, many of which are not at all
related to finding a physical path. For example, a program that needs
to solve a puzzle of fitting a number of blocks into a limited space
could do this by exploring the various 'paths' it gets by trying to
put a certain block in a certain place. The paths that ends up with
insufficient room for the last blocks are dead ends, and the path that
manages to fit in all blocks is the solution.</p></div><ol class="footnotes"><li><a name="footnote1"></a>Computers are deterministic machines: They always react in the same
