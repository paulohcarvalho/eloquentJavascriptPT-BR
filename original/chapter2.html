That which is not
data, does not exist. Although all data is in essence just a sequence
of bits<a class="footref" href="#footnote1">1</a>, and is thus fundamentally alike, every piece of data plays
its own role. In JavaScript's system, most of this data is neatly
separated into things called <a name="key1"></a>values. Every value has a type, which
determines the kind of role it can play. There are six basic types of
values: Numbers, strings, booleans, objects, functions, and undefined
values.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2c1d45c9" name="p2c1d45c9"> ¶ </a>To create a value, one must merely invoke its name. This is very
convenient. You don't have to gather building material for your
values, or pay for them, you just call for one and <em>woosh</em>, you have
it. They are not created from thin air, of course. Every value has to
be stored somewhere, and if you want to use a gigantic number of them
at the same time you might run out of computer memory. Fortunately,
this is only a problem if you need them all simultaneously. As soon as
you no longer use a value, it will dissipate, leaving behind only a
few bits. These bits are recycled to make the next generation of
values.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p19562003" name="p19562003"> ¶ </a>Values of the type <a name="key2"></a>number are, as you might have deduced, numeric
values. They are written the way numbers are usually written:</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="atom">144</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1f52a0a5" name="p1f52a0a5"> ¶ </a>Enter that in the console, and the same thing is printed in the output
window. The text you typed in gave rise to a number value, and the
console took this number and wrote it out to the screen again. In a
case like this, that was a rather pointless exercise, but soon we will
be producing values in less straightforward ways, and it can be useful
to 'try them out' on the console to see what they produce.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p80cb806" name="p80cb806"> ¶ </a>This is what <code>144</code> looks like in bits<a class="footref" href="#footnote2">2</a>:</p><pre class="preformatted">0100000001100010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1b9e3d68" name="p1b9e3d68"> ¶ </a>The number above has 64 bits. Numbers in JavaScript always do. This
has one important repercussion: There is a limited amount of different
numbers that can be expressed. With three decimal digits, only the
numbers 0 to 999 can be written, which is 10<sup>3</sup> = 1000 different
numbers. With 64 binary digits, 2<sup>64</sup> different numbers can be written.
This is a lot, more than 10<sup>19</sup> (a one with nineteen zeroes).</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p72d2d6de" name="p72d2d6de"> ¶ </a>Not all whole numbers below 10<sup>19</sup> fit in a JavaScript number though.
For one, there are also negative numbers, so one of the bits has to be
used to store the sign of the number. A bigger issue is that non-whole
numbers must also be represented. To do this, 11 bits are used to
store the position of the fractional dot within the number.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p69fbfdd9" name="p69fbfdd9"> ¶ </a>That leaves 52 bits<a class="footref" href="#footnote3">3</a>. Any whole number less than 2<sup>52</sup> (which is more
than 10<sup>15</sup>) will safely fit in a JavaScript number. In most cases, the
numbers we are using stay well below that, so we do not have to
concern ourselves with bits at all. Which is good. I have nothing in
particular against bits, but you <em>do</em> need a terrible lot of them to
get anything done. When at all possible, it is more pleasant to deal
with bigger things.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3986de35" name="p3986de35"> ¶ </a>Fractional numbers are written by using a dot.</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="atom">9.81</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#pb4a36c6" name="pb4a36c6"> ¶ </a>For very big or very small numbers, one can also use 'scientific'

bits are guaranteed to always be precise. Unfortunately, calculations
with fractional numbers are generally not. The same way that π (pi) can not be
precisely expressed by a finite amount of decimal digits, many numbers
lose some precision when only 64 bits are available to store them.
This is a shame, but it only causes practical problems in very
specific situations. The important thing is to be aware of it, and
treat fractional digital numbers as approximations, not as precise
values.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p355f31b3" name="p355f31b3"> ¶ </a>The main thing to do with numbers is arithmetic. Arithmetic operations
such as addition or multiplication take two number values and produce
a new number from them. Here is what they look like in JavaScript:</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="atom">100</span> + <span class="atom">4</span> * <span class="atom">11</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5df9439a" name="p5df9439a"> ¶ </a>The <a name="key3"></a><code>+</code> and <a name="key4"></a><code>*</code> symbols are called operators. The first stands for
addition, and the second for multiplication. Putting an operator
between two values will <a name="key5"></a>apply it to those values, and
produce a new value.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p40d95ac7" name="p40d95ac7"> ¶ </a>Does the example mean 'add 4 and 100, and multiply the result by 11',
or is the multiplication done before the adding? As you might have
guessed, the multiplication happens first. But, as in mathematics,
this can be changed by wrapping the addition in parentheses<a name="key6"></a>:</p><pre class="code expression">(<span class="atom">100</span> + <span class="atom">4</span>) * <span class="atom">11</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p50d8329c" name="p50d8329c"> ¶ </a>For subtraction, there is the <a name="key7"></a><code>-</code> operator, and division can be done
with <a name="key8"></a><code>/</code>. When operators appear together without parentheses, the
order in which they are applied is determined by the <a name="key9"></a>precedence of
the operators. The first example shows that multiplication has a
higher precedence than addition. Division and multiplication always
come before subtraction and addition. When multiple operators with the
same precedence appear next to each other (<code>1 - 1 + 1</code>) they are
applied left-to-right.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p41cb7a91" name="p41cb7a91"> ¶ </a>Try to figure out what value this produces, and then run it to see if
you were correct...</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="atom">115</span> * <span class="atom">4</span> - <span class="atom">4</span> + <span class="atom">88</span> / <span class="atom">2</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p25c63f52" name="p25c63f52"> ¶ </a>These rules of precedence are not something you should worry about.
When in doubt, just add parentheses.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p762478e7" name="p762478e7"> ¶ </a>There is one more arithmetic operator which is probably less familiar
to you. The <a name="key10"></a><code>%</code> symbol is used to represent the <a name="key11"></a>remainder operation.
<code>X % Y</code> is the remainder of dividing <code>X</code> by <code>Y</code>. For example
<code>314 % 100</code> is <code>14</code>, <code>10 % 3</code> is <code>1</code>, and <code>144 % 12</code> is <code>0</code>. Remainder
has the same precedence as multiplication and division.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4a3424f8" name="p4a3424f8"> ¶ </a>The next data type is the <a name="key12"></a>string. Its use is not as evident from its
name as with numbers, but it also fulfills a very basic role. Strings
are used to represent text, the name supposedly derives from the fact
that it strings together a bunch of characters. Strings are written by
enclosing their content in quotes:</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="string">&quot;Patch my boat with chewing gum.&quot;</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2578d13f" name="p2578d13f"> ¶ </a>Almost anything can be put between double quotes, and JavaScript will
make a string value out of it. But a few characters are tricky. You
can imagine how putting quotes between quotes might be hard. Newlines,
<a name="key13"></a>the things you get when you press enter, can also not be put
between quotes, the string has to stay on a single line.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5b134df3" name="p5b134df3"> ¶ </a>To be able to have such characters in a string, the following trick is
used: Whenever a backslash ('<code>\</code>') is found inside quoted text, it
indicates that the character after it has a special meaning. A quote
that is preceded by a backslash will not end the string, but be part
of it. When an '<code>n</code>' character occurs after a backslash, it is
interpreted as a newline. Similarly, a '<code>t</code>' after a backslash means a
tab character<a class="footref" href="#footnote4">4</a>.</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="string">&quot;This is the first line\nAnd this is the second&quot;</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p38a5cda" name="p38a5cda"> ¶ </a>Note that if you type this into the console, it'll display it back in
'source' form, with the quotes and backslash escapes. To see only the
actual text, you can type <code>print(&quot;a\nb&quot;)</code>. What that does precisely
will be clarified a little further on.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p69b5ec55" name="p69b5ec55"> ¶ </a>There are of course situations where you want a backslash in a string
to be just a backslash, not a special code. If two backslashes follow
each other, they will collapse right into each other, and only one
will be left in the resulting string value:</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="string">&quot;A newline character is written like \&quot;\\n\&quot;.&quot;</span></pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p78af27fc" name="p78af27fc"> ¶ </a>Strings can not be divided, multiplied, or subtracted. The <a name="key14"></a><code>+</code>
operator <em>can</em> be used on them. It does not add, but it concatenates,
it glues two strings together.</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="string">&quot;con&quot;</span> + <span class="string">&quot;cat&quot;</span> + <span class="string">&quot;e&quot;</span> + <span class="string">&quot;nate&quot;</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p52eb7d44" name="p52eb7d44"> ¶ </a>There are more ways of manipulating strings, but these are discussed
later.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p66e362e9" name="p66e362e9"> ¶ </a>Not all operators are symbols, some are written as words. For example,
the <a name="key15"></a><code>typeof</code> operator, which produces a string value naming the type
of the value you give it.</p><pre class="code expression">typeof <span class="atom">4.5</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1393153f" name="p1393153f"> ¶ </a>The other operators we saw all operated on two values, <code>typeof</code> takes
only one. Operators that use two values are called <a name="key16"></a>binary operators,
while those that take one are called <a name="key17"></a>unary operators. The
<a name="key18"></a>minus operator can be used both as a binary and a unary
operator:</p><pre class="code expression">- (<span class="atom">10</span> - <span class="atom">2</span>)</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1d28c375" name="p1d28c375"> ¶ </a>Then there are values of the <a name="key19"></a>boolean type. There are only two of
these: <a name="key20"></a><code>true</code> and <a name="key21"></a><code>false</code>. Here is one way to produce a <code>true</code>
value:</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="atom">3</span> &gt; <span class="atom">2</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p64212834" name="p64212834"> ¶ </a>And <code>false</code> can be produced like this:</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="atom">3</span> &lt; <span class="atom">2</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3e739e44" name="p3e739e44"> ¶ </a>I hope you have seen the <a name="key22"></a><code>&gt;</code> and <a name="key23"></a><code>&lt;</code> signs before. They mean,
respectively, 'is greater than' and 'is less than'. They are binary
operators, and the result of applying them is a boolean value that
indicates whether they hold in this case.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2dc50e01" name="p2dc50e01"> ¶ </a>Strings can be compared in the same way:</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="string">&quot;Aardvark&quot;</span> &lt; <span class="string">&quot;Zoroaster&quot;</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p7e3e4694" name="p7e3e4694"> ¶ </a>The way strings are ordered is more or less alphabetic. More or
less... Uppercase letters are always 'less' than lowercase ones, so
<code>&quot;Z&quot; &lt; &quot;a&quot;</code> (upper-case Z, lower-case a) is <code>true</code>, and non-alphabetic
characters ('<code>!</code>', '<code>@</code>', etc) are also included in the ordering. The
actual way in which the comparison is done is based on the <a name="key24"></a>Unicode
standard. This standard assigns a number to virtually every character
one would ever need, including characters from Greek, Arabic,
Japanese, Tamil, and so on. Having such numbers is practical for
storing strings inside a computer ― you can represent them as a list
of numbers. When comparing strings, JavaScript just compares the
numbers of the characters inside the string, from left to right.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p16c0de67" name="p16c0de67"> ¶ </a>Other similar operators are <a name="key25"></a><code>&gt;=</code> ('is greater than or equal to'),
<a name="key26"></a><code>&lt;=</code> (is less than or equal to), <a name="key27"></a><code>==</code> ('is equal to'), and <a name="key28"></a><code>!=</code>

values themselves. JavaScript supports three logical operators: <em>and</em>,
<em>or</em>, and <em>not</em>. These can be used to 'reason' about booleans.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p573b490c" name="p573b490c"> ¶ </a>The <a name="key29"></a><code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator represents logical <em>and</em>. It is a binary operator,

can usually get by with knowing that of the operators we have seen so
far, <code>||</code> has the lowest precedence, then comes <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, then the
comparison operators (<code>&gt;</code>, <code>==</code>, etcetera), and then the rest. This
has been chosen in such a way that, in simple cases, as few
parentheses as possible are necessary.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p65af5913" name="p65af5913"> ¶ </a>All the examples so far have used the language like you would use a
pocket calculator. Make some values and apply operators to them to get
new values. Creating values like this is an essential part of every
JavaScript program, but it is only a part. A piece of code that
produces a value is called an <a name="key32"></a>expression. Every value that is
written directly (such as <code>22</code> or <code>&quot;psychoanalysis&quot;</code>) is an
expression. An expression between parentheses is also an expression.
And a binary operator applied to two expressions, or a unary operator
applied to one, is also an expression.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5b67046e" name="p5b67046e"> ¶ </a>There are a few more ways of building expressions, which will be
revealed when the time is ripe.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p62c355c2" name="p62c355c2"> ¶ </a>There exists a unit that is bigger than an expression. It is called a
<a name="key33"></a>statement. A program is built as a list of statements. Most
statements end with a <a name="key34"></a>semicolon (<code>;</code>). The simplest kind of
statement is an expression with a semicolon after it. This is a
program:</p><pre class="code"><span class="atom">1</span>;
!<span class="atom">false</span>;</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p29a7e8db" name="p29a7e8db"> ¶ </a>It is a useless program. An expression can be content to just produce
a value, but a statement only amounts to something if it somehow
changes the world. It could print something to the screen ― that
counts as changing the world ― or it could change the internal state
of the program in a way that will affect the statements that come
after it. These changes are called '<a name="key35"></a>side effects'. The statements in
the example above just produce the values <code>1</code> and <code>true</code>, and then
immediately throw them into the bit bucket<a class="footref" href="#footnote5">5</a>. This leaves no
impression on the world at all, and is not a side effect.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p65170986" name="p65170986"> ¶ </a>How does a program keep an internal state? How does it remember
things? We have seen how to produce new values from old values, but
this does not change the old values, and the new value has to be
immediately used or it will dissipate again. To catch and hold values,
JavaScript provides a thing called a <a name="key36"></a>variable.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">caught</span> = <span class="atom">5</span> * <span class="atom">5</span>;</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p405a34f5" name="p405a34f5"> ¶ </a>A variable always has a name, and it can point at a value, holding on

the console, and it will retrieve the value <code>25</code> for you. The name of
a variable is used to fetch its value. <code>caught + 1</code> also works. A
variable name can be used as an expression, and thus can be part of
bigger expressions.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p47e8e505" name="p47e8e505"> ¶ </a>The word <a name="key37"></a><code>var</code> is used to create a new variable. After <code>var</code>, the
name of the variable follows. Variable names can be almost every word,
but they may not include spaces. Digits can be part of variable names,
<code>catch22</code> is a valid name, but the name must not start with a digit. The
characters '<code>$</code>' and '<code>_</code>' can be used in names as if they were
letters, so <code>$_$</code> is a correct variable name.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p223643ae" name="p223643ae"> ¶ </a>If you want the new variable to immediately capture a value, which is

Generally, this piece of program does something useful, which can be
invoked using the function value that contains it. In a browser
environment, the variable <a name="key41"></a><code>alert</code> holds a function that shows a
little dialog window with a message.

other blocks, it can become hard to see where one block ends and

is not a number. All arithmetic operations on the value <code>NaN</code> result
in <code>NaN</code>, which is why multiplying it by <code>5</code>, as in the example, still
gives a <code>NaN</code> value. Also, and this can be disorienting at times, <code>NaN

rather weird and error prone. Even though <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are both
arithmetic operators, they behave completely different in the example.
In my own code, I use <code>+</code> to combine strings and non-strings a lot,
but make it a point not to use <code>*</code> and the other numeric operators on
string values. Converting a number to a string is always possible and
straightforward, but converting a string to a number may not even work
(as in the last line of the example). We can use <code>Number</code> to
explicitly convert the string to a number, making it clear that we
might run the risk of getting a <code>NaN</code> value.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">Number</span>(<span class="string">&quot;5&quot;</span>) * <span class="atom">5</span>);</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2a2437b2" name="p2a2437b2"> ¶ </a>When we discussed the boolean operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> earlier, I
claimed they produced boolean values. This turns out to be a bit of an
oversimplification. If you apply them to boolean values, they will
indeed return booleans. But they can also be applied to other kinds of
values, in which case they will return one of their arguments.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p43c2cac3" name="p43c2cac3"> ¶ </a>What <a name="key88"></a><code>||</code> really does is this: It looks at the value to the left of
it first. If converting this value to a boolean would produce <code>true</code>,
it returns this left value, otherwise it returns the one on its
right. Check for yourself that this does the correct thing when the
arguments are booleans. Why does it work like that? It turns out this
is very practical. Consider this example:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">input</span> = <span class="variable">prompt</span>(<span class="string">&quot;What is your name?&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;Kilgore Trout&quot;</span>);

other way without giving a name, the variable <code>input</code> will hold the
value <code>null</code> or <code>&quot;&quot;</code>. Both of these would give <code>false</code> when converted
to a boolean. The expression <code>input || &quot;dear&quot;</code> can in this case be
read as 'the value of the variable <code>input</code>, or else the string
<code>&quot;dear&quot;</code>'. It is an easy way to provide a 'fallback' value.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p710746e" name="p710746e"> ¶ </a>The <a name="key89"></a><code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator works similarly, but the other way around. When

the value on its right.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p74770a64" name="p74770a64"> ¶ </a>Another property of these two operators is that the expression to
their right is only evaluated when necessary. In the case of <code>true ||

evaluated, and if it has side effects they never happen. The same goes
